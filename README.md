# Neural Net Simulator 2k19
A Fake Machine Learning Simulator with a GUI

Ever wanted to seem like a ML master but have no idea what you're doing? This app is perfect for you!

*"All my friends think I'm a CS god now!"* - Haas Snake

*"Now my boss thinks I'm busy training my model while I'm actually just playing Hearthstone lmao"* - Bored CS boi

*"Why did you make this?"* - confused friend

Use this app to fool your friends! Use this app to fool your boss! Woohoo!

# Features

The app offers 6 different variables that a user can change:
1) Starting Accuracy: The accuracy to start with at the beginning of "training".
2) Starting Loss: The loss to start with at the beginning of "training".
3) Number of Samples: Number of samples to take in each epoch.
4) Average Training Time per Sample: The average training time for each sample in an epoch (in seconds).
5) Training Time Variance: The variance in training times per sample.
6) Number of Epochs: The number of epochs to simulate.

Running the app opens a new terminal window that begins to simulate training and exits upon completion. The app also has a force stop button.

# Remarks

I felt like I needed to learn how to make GUIs at some point so here's my first attempt at one. Hopefully someone finds it useful lol.
